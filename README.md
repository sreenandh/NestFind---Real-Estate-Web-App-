# NestFind Real Estate Web Application

NestFind is a full-stack web application designed to simplify the process of finding, buying, renting, or selling properties. It features secure user registration with OTP-based email verification, dynamic property listings with filtering options, real-time chat functionality, and an admin panel for managing user accounts.

## Features

- **User Registration with OTP Verification:**  
  New users register by providing their credentials, after which a 6-digit OTP is generated and sent to their email (using Nodemailer with Gmail). Users verify the OTP to complete their registration.

- **Secure Authentication & Authorization:**  
  JWT tokens are generated upon login and stored in HTTP-only cookies. Protected routes ensure that only authenticated users can access sensitive pages, with additional admin-only routes for management functions.

- **Dynamic Property Listings & Filtering:**  
  Users can browse property listings and apply filters based on city, property type (e.g., apartment, house), price range, and bedroom count. The filter criteria update the URLâ€™s query parameters for easy sharing and bookmarking.

- **Real-Time Chat:**  
  Real-time messaging is implemented using Socket.IO, enabling instant communication between users about property details.

- **Admin Panel:**  
  An admin dashboard (accessible with default credentials: username **SreenandhM**, password **admin123**) allows for viewing user details and deleting user accounts.
